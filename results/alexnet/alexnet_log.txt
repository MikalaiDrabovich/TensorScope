***Comparison completed***
See data_compared.tsv to select candidates for optimization in system1.
- See column D 'Time ratio Sys1/Sys2 (one call)'. This is how many times an op is faster in system2 compared to system1.
- Ops are sorted by total time in the 1st (slower) system.
- To cover, for example, 80% of time spent in system1, see values in column M ('System1 cumulative % of total time')
Good candidates for further optimizations will be ops from the first row to the row with value of about 0.8 (80%) in column M
- Unmatched ops saved to data_unmatched_ops.tsv. Take a look there to see if some time consuming ops are actually unique to system1 and system2.
- Baselines for system1 are in column B ('Time of 1 call, microseconds'). By default, these values are averaged over 100 runs (aka steps, batches) and 10 warm-up steps.
